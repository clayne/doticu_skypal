; This is your go-to method to start your filter, as it's more performant to work with less refs.

    Filters:
        Each filter has its modes listed above its signature.

        Each sorter has its modes listed above its signature.

    Iterators:
        It may actually be faster to let C++ iterate for you. Return true to keep iterating or false to stop.
        If the script with the callback is extended from a Form (e.g. Quest) use Form_For_Each.
        If the script with the callback is extended from an Alias, use Alias_For_Each.
        If the script with the callback is extended from an ActiveMagicEffect, use Active_Magic_Effect_For_Each.
        Global_For_Each can be used on any script, as long as the callabck has the global keyword on it.
